- Introduction to Browser Forensics
    - 15-minute introduction to browser forensics intended for SOC / IR analysts and beginning practitioners. Covers the basic auditing mechanisms performed by major browsers (focusing on Google Chrome due to market share) and how these mechanisms can be used to provide investigative value. Due to the potential for abuse, talk will also cover the ethics of handling this type of information.
